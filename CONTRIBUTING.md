# Contributing to the Photo Editor

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! We welcome any help you can offer.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the main project.

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Acatas/editor/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Acatas/editor/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue and describe the enhancement you have in mind.
- Please be specific and provide as much detail as possible.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

- Follow the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) file for code styling. If you don't have one, we will add one.
- For this project, we are using a mix of PHP, Python, and JavaScript. Please follow the standard style guides for each language.

We look forward to your contributions!
